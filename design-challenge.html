	<h1>Design Challenge Questions</h1>
	<p class="info">Design Challenge: Created with the help of worksheet from the Human Centered Design Toolkit helps frame the challenge as an actionable question.</p>
				</header>
						<p><strong>What is the problem you are trying to solve?</strong></p>
						<p>- Inform people about the hardships pit bulls have faced as a breed and help these dogs find a forever home.</p>
						<p><strong>1. Frame it as a question:</strong></p>
						<p>- How can we show people that pit bulls are loving dogs and show them adoption opportunities?</p>
						<p><strong>2. Now, state the ultimate impact you’re trying to have.</strong></p>
						<p>- Give pit bulls in the Los Angles area a chance to find a home with people who understand the bad wrap that the breed has been given and will love them.</p>
						<p><strong>3. What are some possible solutions to your problem?</strong></p>
						<p>- Creating a more user friendly platform where people can get more information about the organization.</p>
						<p><strong>4. Finally, write down some of the context and constraints that you’re facing.</strong></p>
						<p>- Having to overcome the thoughts that people have against pit bulls.</p>
						<p>- Showcasing all the information in a clean yet effective way.</p>
						<p><strong>5. Does your original question need a tweak? Try it again.</strong></p>
						<p>- How can we overcome the thoughts people have against the pit bull breed and show that they are loving animals while showcasing the opprotunities of adoption, donation, and volunteer.</p>
